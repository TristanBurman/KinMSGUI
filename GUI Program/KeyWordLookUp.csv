Key Inputs,Required Values for Fitting
    Disk Thickness,The disc scaleheight in arcseconds.
    Inclination,Inclination angle of the gas disc on the sky. Units of Degrees.
    Int Flux,Total integrated flux you want the output gas to have. Units Jy/km/s.
    Mask Clipping Level,Float for the clipping level. Higher number indicates a higher signal to noise ratio.
    Position Angle,"Position angle of the disc, using the usual astronomical convention."
    Velocity Dispersion,Velocity dispersion of the gas. Units of km/s.
Simulation Options,Options to edit simulaion defaults
    Method of Minimisation,Method of Minimsation .
    Max Number of Iterations,Max Number of Iterations for fitting algorithm.
    Number Of KinMS Cloudlet Samples,"Number of cloudlets to use to create the model. Large numbers will reduce numerical noise (especially in large cubes),  at the cost of increasing runtime."

            COBYLA,Minimize a scalar function of one or more variables using the Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation (COBYLA) algorithm.
            Nelder-Mead,Minimization of scalar function of one or more variables using the Nelder-Mead algorithm.
            Powell,Minimization of scalar function of one or more variables using the modified Powell algorithm.
        Bounded Methods,The methods consider variable boundaries.
            L-BFGS-B,Minimize a scalar function of one or more variables using the L-BFGS-B algorithm.
            SLSQP,Minimize a scalar function of one or more variables using Sequential Least SQuares Programming (SLSQP).
